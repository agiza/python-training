# Terminal Menu

This is a simple Python script which shows a game menu on terminal using Python's [*curses library*](https://docs.python.org/2/library/curses.html). It's created as a training exercise while learning Python.

## Usage
Download the script and give execute permission to the script.

```bash
$ chmod +x menu.py
$ python menu.py
```

Then use arrow keys (up/down) or 'j' and 'k' (vi/vim mode) to select menu.
